# dartz (Flutter Records Edition)

A modern Dart package inspired by the popular [dartz](https://pub.dev/packages/dartz) library,
reimagined to showcase Dart's new [records](https://dart.dev/language/records) feature. This library
brings functional programming tools and data structures into your Flutter and Dart projects,
utilizing clean, concise syntax with records for enhanced productivity and expressiveness.

## Features

- Functional programming constructs with Dart's record types
- Type-safe value tuples and utility helpers
- Collections and operations inspired by dartz, but embracing idiomatic Dart 3 syntax
- Lightweight and fully compatible with Flutter projects
